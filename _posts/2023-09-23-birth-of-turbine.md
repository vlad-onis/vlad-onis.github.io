In our previous post we explored TCP basics which layed the groundwork for our didactic web server called turbine. "A turbine is a machine for producing continuous power in which a wheel or rotor, typically fitted with vanes, is made to revolve by a fast-moving flow of water, steam, gas, air, or other fluid.", similarly our turbine will convert requests into work as we'll see in the following posts!

## Introduction

At a very basic level a web server will receive requests from a client at will execute them before returning a response to the client. This is also called the server-client model where the client wait for a response from the server. 

Looking at the diagram below, we want to understand what the server is actually doing before producing a response.

## How servers serve

Well, before serving anything to the client, the server has to understand the request. In our case we are talking about an HTTP request. HyperText Transfer Protocol defines the model of communication between the client and the server. For in depth details you can look into this [RFC for HTTP version 1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231) which is easier to understand and defines the methods, the message structure and much more.

Generally speaking, an HTTP message will consist of headers and body. The headers are providing information about the request (what method are we using - GET/POST/DELETE etc, what content type, what is the content length etc). 

So the first job of turbine will be to understand headers.

## Just got a request

The GET method is used by the client when they want to retrieve something from the server. For example when you access https://google.com your browser does a GET request to their server and the server returns the google page in response which your browser then displays.

So let's look at some rust code for parsing a simple GET request.

```rust
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024]; // Adjust buffer size as needed
    let mut request = Vec::new();

    loop {

        // don't worry about the unwrap for now, we'll explore
        // error handling in the next post.
        let bytes_read = stream.read(&mut buffer).unwrap_or(0);

        if bytes_read == 0 {
            break; // Connection was closed
        }

        request.extend_from_slice(&buffer[..bytes_read]);

        // Check if the end of the request is reached
        if request.ends_with(b"\r\n\r\n") {
            break;
        }
    }

    let request = String::from_utf8_lossy(&request).to_string();
```

Let me explain this code snippet bit by bit. First you want to create a buffer where we read in chunks of 1024 bytes, and the request which is our final result. We start reading from the TCPStream in a loop, appending everything we read to the request. We stop only if reading doesn't return anything or if the end of the request is reached (HTTP defines the end of a request as 2 newlines written like \r\n\r\n).

In the end we convert the vector of bytest that we have to a String, replacing all the non utf8 bytest with ï¿½ (this is done by from_utf8_lossy method of String).
