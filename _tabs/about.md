Hi there,
I'm Vlad, some friends call me Vladonis, I'm a software engineer that's always searching for the perfect answer to
the question "how (the hell) does this work?". Now with this description it may come natural that I picked Rust as 
the tool of choice for somebody that's digging details for a living. 

This blog represents just my effort to transform my hand written notes(yes I know what notion is) into their digital 
counter part, hoping that other people or my future self will benefit from what is written here.

Besides Rust and technical stuff, I'm into wooden musical instruments like guitars, traditional flutes and others. Sportwise 
I'm still trying to improve the ways in which I move this (older and older) body; talk to me about climbing. üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
